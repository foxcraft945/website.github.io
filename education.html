    <h2 align="center">Educational Background of David E. Hurtubise, Ph.D.</h2>
    <p>David graduated with highest honors from the University of Notre Dame in
      June of 1990.&nbsp; While at the University of Notre Dame he was enrolled
      in an Arts and Sciences honors program as well as an honors program within
      the Mathematics Department.&nbsp; He took nearly every undergraduate
      mathematics course offered at the University of Notre Dame, as well as
      graduate courses in complex analysis and logic.&nbsp; He also took five
      semesters of physics, including a semester of classical mechanics.</p>
    <p>While at the University of Notre Dame David participated in an research
      project with Dr. John Kozak, a physical chemist, developing mathematical
      models for chemical reaction rates on molecular organizates and colloidal
      catalysts. This research resulted in two publication in the <em>Journal
        of Physical Chemistry</em>.&nbsp; David also worked for the biocore
      facility setting up and maintaining their molecular modeling computer
      lab.&nbsp; This work involved programming in Fortran and C, TCP/IP
      networking, and system administration for both Unix and Vax/VMS computers.</p>
    <p>In 1990 David was admitted to Stanford University with a National Science
      Foundation Graduate Fellowship.&nbsp; At Stanford University he studied
      algebraic topology and homotopy theory.&nbsp; In addition to the usual
      coursework on abstract algebra, complex analysis, real analysis,
      differential geometry, and topology, he also participated in several
      reading courses on classical mechanics, gauge theory, and general
      relativity.</p>
    <p>David's Stanford Ph.D. thesis, <strong>The Floer Homotopy Type of
        Grassmann Manifolds</strong> (1995), attempted to give a geometric
      interpretation of Floer cohomology in terms of stable homotopy theory
      following a program laid out by Cohen, Jones, and Segal.&nbsp; The
      interpretation was complete for the case of height functions on complex
      Grassmann manifolds.&nbsp; For the case of the action functional on the
      loop space of a complex Grassmann manifold the flow category was described
      in detail, but the compactification of the morphism spaces needed to
      define the Floer homotopy type was discussed only for the case of complex
      projective spaces (following CJS).</p>
